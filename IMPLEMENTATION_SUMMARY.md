# Angry Girlfriend Game - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A top-down narrative game where the player must win back their angry girlfriend (Olivia/Penny) through dialogue. The game uses Player2AI for LLM-powered NPC responses with mood-aware behavior.

---

## Core Game Loop

```
Player enters house
    → Girlfriend speaks (LLM response)
    → Player types message OR speaks (voice input)
    → Intent classified → Mood changes
    → System prompt updated if mood tier changed
    → LLM receives world_status context
    → Girlfriend responds based on mood (text + TTS)
    → Repeat until Win (mood >= 80) or Lose (mood <= 0)
```

---

## Mood System

### Configuration
- **Range**: 0-100
- **Starting mood**: 50
- **Win threshold**: 80
- **Lose threshold**: 0

### Mood Deltas (defined in `autoload/game_state.gd`)
| Intent | Delta |
|--------|-------|
| apology | +10 |
| empathy | +15 |
| explanation | +5 |
| do_dishes | +15 |
| clean | +10 |
| give_food | +20 |
| lie | -10 |
| insult | -15 |
| gaslight | -20 |
| nonsense | -5 |

### Flags
Tracked actions that provide context to the LLM:
- `apologized`
- `did_dishes`
- `cleaned`
- `ordered_food`
- `gave_food`

## LLM Integration (Player2AI)

### Two-Pronged Mood-Aware System

#### 1. World Status (Every Message)
Injected via `ai_npc.notify()` before each chat. Contains:
- Current emotional state description (no numbers)
- Status of completed actions

Example:
```
"Your current emotional state: You're angry and hurt, demanding real effort. | So far: received an apology, they did the dishes"
```

#### 2. Dynamic System Prompt (On Tier Change)
21 mood tiers (every 5 points). System prompt updates when crossing thresholds.

| Tier | Mood Range | Personality |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 0 | 0-4 | Furious, about to leave |
| 4 | 20-24 | Upset and defensive |
| 6 | 30-34 | Guarded but present |
| 10 | 50-54 | Softening |
| 14 | 70-74 | Forgiving |
| 20 | 100 | Blissfully happy |

## Known Issues / TODOs

1. `IntentClassifier` autoload may need implementation - currently referenced but not seen
2. Win/lose screens not implemented (just prints to console)
3. Power HUD still displays - needs manual config change to hide
4. Conversation history persists between sessions (by design, can reset with TAB)
